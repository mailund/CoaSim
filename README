CoaSim is a tool for simulating the coalescent process with
recombination and gene-conversion under the assumption of exponential
population growth. It effectively constructs the ancestral
recombination graph for a given number of individuals and uses this to
simulate samples of SNP and micro- satellite haplotypes/genotypes. The
generated sample can afterwards be separated in cases and controls,
depending on states of selected individual markers. The tool can
accordingly also be used to construct cases and control data sets for
association studies.

Usage:
------

The CoaSim tool comes in two flavours: a command line interface and a
graphical user interface.  The command line interface (the program
`coasim') reads a number of run-commands from a file to configure the
simulation; the graphical user interface (the program `coasim_gui') is
configured through a number of dialogue windows.

 
The parameters that specify the simulation are:

 * number of leaves: The number of leaf-nodes the simulated ancestral
   recombination graph (ARG) should contain.

 * gene-conversion rate: The rate of gene conversions
 * gene-conversion length: The rate used in estimating the length of
   gene conversions.
 * recombination rate: The recombination rate.
 * growth: The exponential growth parameter (if 0 a constant
   population size is used)
 * mutate rate: The mutation rate for micro satellites.

 * positions: The locations of markers (in the range [0.0,1.0[)
 * marker types: The type of the markers:
	  - snp: 	SNP markers
	  - traits:	Traits, useful e.g. for distinguishing cases
			from controls
	  - ms:		Micro-satellites
 * mutation frequency: low/high frequency of mutation allele, for SNP
   and trait markers
 * alphabet size: Alphabet size for micro-satellite markers.

 * print all nodes: Print the full ARG, as opposed to just printing
   the leaves.


The command line interface reads the parameters from a run-command
file of the form:

-- sample.rc -------------------------------------------------

no_leaves: 		10	# number of leaves

gene_conversion_rate:   250.0	# gene-conversion rate
gene_conversion_length: 250.0   # gene-conversion length

recombination_rate:     0.01    # recombination rate

growth:			0.0     # growth

mutation_rate:		0.001   # mutation rate


positions: 0.1 0.2 0.3   0.4 0.6 0.9   # marker positions
markers:   snp snp trait ms  snp snp   # types of markers
low_freq:  0.1 0.1 0.1   0.0 0.2 0.2   # low freq for traits and snps
high_freq: 0.2 0.2 0.2   0.0 0.4 0.4   # high freq for traits and snps
no_values: 0   0   0     4   0   0     # no possible values for ms

print_all_nodes: true

-- /sample.rc ------------------------------------------------


The GUI program obtains the ARG construction and mutation parameters
from the main window and the marker types, positions, and parameters
from the "Add Marker" dialogue window.



The simulation output is written to an XML file.  The XML output can
be processed in a number of ways. Using the XSLT script
coasim_to_dot.xsl the XML file can be transformed to dot format which
can be used to construct a postscript version of the generated
ancestral recombination graph. The program 'dot' is part of GraphViz
<URL:http://www.graphviz.org/>. Using the script seperate.py the
sequences at the leaf nodes can be separated into cases and controls
depending on specific alleles.  See the README_seperate file for
details.
