CoaSim is a tool for simulating the coalescent process with
recombination and gene-conversion under the assumption of exponential
population growth. It effectively constructs the ancestral
recombination graph for a given number of individuals and uses this to
simulate samples of SNP and micro- satellite haplotypes/genotypes. The
generated sample can afterwards be separated in cases and controls,
depending on states of selected individual markers. The tool can
accordingly also be used to construct cases and control data sets for
association studies.

Usage:
------

The CoaSim tool comes in two flavours: a command line interface and a
graphical user interface.  The command line interface (the program
`coasim') reads a number of run-commands from a file to configure the
simulation; the graphical user interface (the program `coasim_gui') is
configured through a number of dialogue windows.

 
The parameters that specify the simulation are:

 * number of leaves: The number of leaf-nodes the simulated ancestral
   recombination graph (ARG) should contain.

 * gene-conversion rate: The rate of gene conversions
 * gene-conversion length: The rate used in estimating the length of
   gene conversions.
 * recombination rate: The recombination rate.
 * growth: The exponential growth parameter (if 0 a constant
   population size is used)
 * mutate rate: The mutation rate for micro satellites.

 * positions: The locations of markers (in the range [0.0,1.0[)
 * marker types: The type of the markers:
	  - snp: 	SNP markers
	  - traits:	Traits, useful e.g. for distinguishing cases
			from controls
	  - ms:		Micro-satellites
 * mutation frequency: low/high frequency of mutation allele, for SNP
   and trait markers
 * alphabet size: Alphabet size for micro-satellite markers.
 * mutation rates: Mutation rates for micro-satellite markers.


The command line interface reads the parameters from a run-command
file of the form:

-- sample.rc -------------------------------------------------

no_leaves: 		10	# number of leaves

gene_conversion_rate:   250.0	# gene-conversion rate
gene_conversion_length: 250.0   # gene-conversion length

The GUI program obtains the ARG construction and mutation parameters
from the main window and the marker types, positions, and parameters
from the "Add Marker" dialogue window.



The simulation output is written to an XML file.  The XML output can
be processed in a number of ways. Using the XSLT script
coasim_to_dot.xsl the XML file can be transformed to dot format which
can be used to construct a postscript version of the generated
ancestral recombination graph. The program 'dot' is part of GraphViz
<URL:http://www.graphviz.org/>. 

Transforming the XML file output.xml to a postscript representation of
the ARG can be done using the script coasim_to_ps.  The script
translates the coasim XML file to dot and then to PostScript using the
commands:

  $ xsltproc coasim_to_dot.xsl output.xml > arg.dot
  $ dot -Tps -o arg.ps arg.dot

The coasim_to_ps version of the above is:

  $ coasim_to_ps output.xml arg.ps



Using the script coasim_separate the sequences at the leaf nodes
can be separated into cases and controls depending on specific
alleles.  See the README_separate file for details.

Using coasim_separate to generate a case/control data set form the coasim
result file arg.xml can be done as:

  $ coasim_separate -i arg.xml -ocases cases -ocontrols controls \
	-number_disease_markers 1 -disease_positions 0.76 -disease_alleles 1 \
	-number_cases_with_mutation 80 -number_controls_with_mutation 30 \
	-number_controls 100 -number_cases 100 -dtd bioinformatics.dtd -randomphase \
	-text_format
