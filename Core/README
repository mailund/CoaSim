CoaSim is a tool for simulating the coalescent process with
recombination and geneconversion under various demographic models. It
effectively constructs the ancestral recombination graph for a given
number of individuals and uses this to simulate samples of SNP,
micro-satellite, and other haplotypes/genotypes. The generated sample
can afterwards be separated in cases and controls, depending on states
of selected individual markers. The tool can accordingly also be used
to construct cases and control data sets for association studies.

CoaSim is developed in collaboration between Bioinformatics ApS
<http://www.bioinformatics.dk> and Bioinformatics Research Center
(BiRC) <http://www.birc.au.dk>.



CoaSim comes in two versions: a graphical interface with limited
functionality, for exploratory use, and a Guile Scheme interface for
power-use. A short introduction to both versions can be found in the
Getting Started manual
<http://www.daimi.au.dk/~mailund/CoaSim/download/getting-started-4.0.pdf>

This module contains the core functionality, used by both the GUI and
Guile Scheme version.  To use CoaSim you must link this module with
either the GUI og Guile Scheme version, as explained at
<http://www.daimi.au.dk/~mailund/CoaSim/#installation>.
