CoaSim is a tool for simulating the coalescent process with
recombination and geneconversion under various demographic models. It
effectively constructs the ancestral recombination graph for a given
number of individuals and uses this to simulate samples of SNP,
micro-satellite, and other haplotypes/genotypes. The generated sample
can afterwards be separated in cases and controls, depending on states
of selected individual markers. The tool can accordingly also be used
to construct cases and control data sets for association studies.
