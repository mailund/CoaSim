CoaSim installation notes, 4-May-2004
-------------------------------------

The source code of the CoaSim package is distributed in the archive
coasim-a.b.c.tar.gz, where a.b.c refers to the current version. 

1. Unpacking the archive.

     tar xzf coasim-a.b.c.tar.gz

   This creates the subdirectory coasim-a.b.c of the current directory
   containing the source code. Enter this directory:

     cd coasim-a.b.c

2. Preparing for compilation.

   Compilation requires a working C++ tool chain. We have succesfully
   compiled coasim using gnu g++ on Linux and Mac OS X systems. The
   commandline tool coasim requires the popt library for parsing
   commandline arguments, and the coasim gui requires the qt library
   with threading (qt-mt). Install these ibraries if they are not
   already available on your system. If you do not want to build the
   gui then you of course do not need to install the qt library

   On most Linux systems the popt and qt-mt libraries are installed
   but you will probably need to install them by your self on a Mac OS
   X system. If you install the libraries in 'non-standard' places,
   e.g. /sw/lib as the fink on OS X tool does, remember to specify
   this when compiling, otherwise compilation/linking will probably
   fail. (On a OS X system with popt installed in /sw/lib, we have
   succesfully compiled coasim by running make with CXXFLAGS set to
   CXXFLAGS="-Wall -O3 -lpopt -I /sw/include/ -Wl,-L/sw/lib").

   Before compilation, edit the Makefile to set variables

     install_prefix
     bindir
     sharedir

   to fit your system. Set 

     escaped_prefix
     escaped_sharedir

   accordingly. It is important that you have write permission to
   bindir and sharedir since files will be copied to these
   directories during installation.

3. Compilation on a Linux system.

   On a common Linux box, e.g. running RedHat 9.0 or SuSE 9.0
   compilation should be as easy as running make:

     make

   This creates two executables. The commandline tool

     src/coasim

   and the gui tool

     gui/coasim_gui

   To install run

     make install

   which copies the two executables and some python scripts to bindir
   and the xml dtd coasim.dtd to sharedir. You can also move the
   executables elsewhere but it is *important* that coasim.dtd is in
   sharedir.  The location of the dtd can also be set via an
   environment variable, see README.

   To only compile the command-line interface, use

     make make_cli

   and to install it use

     make install_cli
   
4. Compilation on a Mac OS X system.

   On Mac OS X compilation is slightly more complicated 

     cd gui
     qmake
     cd ..
     make
     
   The commandline tool is again 

     src/coasim

   but the gui tool is in the directory

     gui/coasim_gui.app

   To install the commandline tool and the coasim.dtd you can run
   'make install' as above. To install the gui tool move the
   coasim_gui.app to e.g. the Applications folder in your home
   directory, simply drag the coasim_gui icon to the desired location.

   In order to be able to launch qt applications from Finder, it is
   important that you have installed qt correct according to its
   documentation.
